    "Our first goal should always be to come up with a _correct_ solution to the problem, which may not necessarily be the most _efficient_ solution. Try to think of a solution before you read further. \n",
    "\n",
    "Coming up with the correct solution is quite easy, and it's based on this insight: If a list of sorted numbers is rotated `k` times, then the smallest number in the list ends up at position `k` (counting from 0). Further, it is the only number in the list which is smaller than the number before it. Thus, we simply need to **check for each number in the list whether it is smaller than the number that comes before it** (if there is a number before it). Then, our answer i.e. the number of rotations is simply the position of this number is . If we cannot find such a number, then the list wasn't rotated at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: In the list `[19, 25, 29, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 14]`, the number `3` is the only number smaller than its predecessor. It occurs at the position `3` (counting from `0`), hence the array was rotated `3` times.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the *linear search* algorithm as a first attempt to solve this problem i.e. we can perform the check for every position one by one. But first, try describing the above solution in your own words, that make it clear to you.\n",
